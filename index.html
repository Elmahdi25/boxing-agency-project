          Discipline is the fuel that transforms aspirations into achievements.
          It is the commitment to daily actions that lead to long-term success.

        <h2 class="card-title">Humble</h2>
        <p>
          In boxing, humility is the cornerstone of growth and resilience. It's
          the recognition that every opponent, victory, and defeat offers
          lessons to learn and room to improve.
