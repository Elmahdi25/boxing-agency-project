# boxing-agency-project
In this project, I focused on adapting to different screen sizes like phones or iPads (680px or larger). I created a mini boxing agency project to handle layout for desktop and mobile views, using media queries. Despite options like flexbox, grid, and Bootstrap, I chose to learn and implement solutions from scratch. Enjoy exploring!
